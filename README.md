# Untappd Dark Mode Theme Userscript
A Userscript to give Untappd's website a sleek looking dark mode theme.

### Installation
You'll need a Userscript manager for your browser. I recommend the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) addon.

Tampermonkey (as well as Greasemonkey and probably most other Userscript managers) will prompt you to install simply by viewing the [.user.js file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjp/untappd-dark-theme/master/untappd-dark-mode-theme.user.js) in your browser. If not, just go to your addon's dashboard and add a new script, pasting in the contents of that file and saving it.
